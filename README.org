See this [[https://blog.mbedded.ninja/programming/operating-systems/linux/how-to-use-socketcan-with-the-command-line-in-linux/][article]] for how to do setup.

We need to create a network device like this:
#+begin_src sh
# first, load the vcan module
sudo modprobe vcan
# then, create the virtual link device
sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
# then, set its state to UP
sudo ip link set vcan0 up
#+end_src

Just to debug, you can run ~candump vcan0~ in one terminal and run ~cansend vcan0 <data>~ in the other.
The data from ~cansend~ should reflect in the ~candump~ output.

After that, run the ~reader~ in one process and the ~writer~ in the other.
The default frame filter only matches CAN ID ~5~.
You can override this by passing in the preprocessor parameter ~CAN_FILTER_ID=<id>~.
You can disable the filter altogether by passing the parameter ~DISABLE_CAN_FILTER~.
